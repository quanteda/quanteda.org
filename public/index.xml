      <description>Based in London, the Quanteda Initiative is a UK non-profit organization devoted to the promotion of open-source text analysis software. It supports active development of these tools, in addition to providing training materials, training events, and sponsoring workshops and conferences. Its main product is the open-source quanteda package for R, but the Quanteda Initiative also supports a family of independent but interrelated packages for providing additional functionality for natural language processing and document management.</description>

      <description>Part of the Quanteda Initiative is to promote the use of the tools whose development it supports through training and dissemination activities. These include publicly accessible workshops, invitation-only conferences, and bespoke training events.
In our workshops we can cover topics such as importing texts and constructing a corpus, tokenization, creating a document-feature matrix, textual statistics (e.g. readability, lexical diversity, collocation analysis), dictionary-based analysis, sentiment analysis, supervised and unsupervised scaling, document classification, topic modelling, and part-of-speech tagging.</description>
