Based in London, the **Quanteda Initiative** is a UK non-profit organization devoted to the promotion of open-source text analysis software. It supports active development of these tools, in addition to providing training materials, training events, and sponsoring workshops and conferences. Its main product is the open-source **quanteda** package for R, but also supports a family of independent but interrelated packages for providing additional functionality for natural language processing and document management.

#### Objectives

As an officially designated "community interest company", the Quanteda Initiative is a [special type of limited company](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-a-social-enterprise) which exists to benefit the community rather than private shareholders. 

Its core objectives, as stated in its charter, are to:

1. Support open-source, text analysis software developed for research and scientific analysis.  These efforts focus mainly on the open-source software library **quanteda**, written for the R programming language, and its [related family of extension packages](https://github.com/quanteda). 

2. Promote interoperability between text analytic software libraries, including those written in other languages such as Python, Java, or C++.

2. Provide ongoing user, technical, and development support for open-source text analysis software.

3. Organize training and dissemination activities related to open-source text analysis software.
