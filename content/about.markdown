### Quanteda Initiative

Based in London, the Quanteda Initiative is a UK non-profit organization devoted to the promotion of open-source text analysis software. It supports active development of these tools, in addition to providing training materials, training events, and sponsoring workshops and conferences. Itâ€™s main product is the open-source quanteda package for R, but also supports a family of independent but interrelated packages for providing additional functionality for natural language processing and document management.

#### Objectives

We develop open source software to achieve following core objectives in quantitative text analysis. 

1. Simplicity and flexibility
    * Create flexible tools for different analytic purposes
    * Provide consistent and intuitive commands for R users
2. Best practice
    * Facilitate transparent and reproducible workflows
3. High efficiency
    * Exploit multi-core CPU's to process large datasets
    * Store large datasets in small RAMs of laptop computers  
4. Inter-operability 
    * Allow **quanteda** to be used in conjunction with other R packages


#### Supporters

**quanteda** project is supported by the European Research Council grant ERC-2011-StG 283794-QUANTESS.
