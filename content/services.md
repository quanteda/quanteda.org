Part of the **Quanteda Initiative** is to promote the use of the tools whose development it supports through training and dissemination activities.  These include publicly accessible workshops, invitation-only conferences, and bespoke training events.

For a list of upcoming events, see the Events category in our [News](/news) section. 

To arrange training in the use of **quanteda** or in quantitative text analysis methodology more broadly, email us at [admin@quanteda.org](mailto:admin@quanteda.org).
