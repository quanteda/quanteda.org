Part of the **Quanteda Initiative** is to promote the use of the tools whose development it supports through training and dissemination activities. These include publicly accessible workshops, invitation-only conferences, and bespoke training events.

Since the foundation of the **Quanteda Initiative** in 2018, we have organized one-day and two-day workshops in Australia (Canberra), Germany (Berlin; Bremen), Ireland (Dublin) and Japan (Kobe).

For a list of upcoming events, see the Events category in our [News](/news) section. 

To arrange training in the use of **quanteda** or in quantitative text analysis methodology more broadly, email us at [admin@quanteda.org](mailto:admin@quanteda.org).
