Kenneth Benoit led an [introductory workshop](http://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/events/quantitative-methods-workshops-students) on quantitative text analysis using R and **quanteda**. The workshop took place on 9 December 2018 as a pre-sessional workshop in Canberra before the [Annual Meeting of the Australian Society for Quantitative Political Science](https://asqps.org.au/2018-annual-conference-canberra/). The tutorial provided an overview of R's capabilities for natural language processing and text analysis. The tutorial also provided an introduction to and survey of **quanteda**'s capabilities, and suggestions for future learning in this area.
