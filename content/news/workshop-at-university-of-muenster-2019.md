Ken Benoit led a two-day workshop on quantitative text analysis using R and **quanteda** at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) on 27-28 June 2019. Participants from the Department of Political Science learned how to import texts, construct a corpus, tokenize text, create a document-feature matrix, and conduct supervised and unsupervised text classification.
