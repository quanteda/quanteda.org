At a meeting of Tokyo R on 15 June 2018 at Yahoo Japan's headquarters, Kohei Watanabe presented an overview of quantitative text analysis and how to implement it using the latest version of [**quanteda**](https://quanteda.io).  The event was attended by more than 200 international delegates, including staff from R Studio.  We thank the organizers for giving us such a great opportunity to publicize our activities and software.
