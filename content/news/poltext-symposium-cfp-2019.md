[POLTEXT](https://www.poltextconference.org) is an international and interdisciplinary symposium on the application of natural language processing techniques in social science research. The third POLTEXT conference, organized by Kohei Watanabe (Chief Technology Officer and a Director of the **Quanteda Initiative**) Miklós Sebők, and Lisa Lechner takes place at Waseda University (Tokyo) on 14-15 September 2019.

The symposium aims to facilitate the knowledge exchange between social scientists and computer scientists who address social, political or economic issues through the analysis of textual data by employing quantitative methods. It also features multi-lingual analysis of textual data to promote the methodology beyond the English language. In this, the symposium will be the first of its kind in Japan. [Jonathan Slapin](https://jonslapin.weebly.com) (University of Essex) and [Amy Catalinac](https://scholar.harvard.edu/amycatalinac/home) (New York University) have been confirmed as keynote speakers related to these two themes, respectively.

The symposium will be preceded by free tutorial sessions on Quantitative Text Analysis in R and Quantitative Analysis of Textual Data using Machine Learning. The tutorials will take place on 13 September 2019.

The [POLTEXT website](https://www.poltextconference.org/call-for-papers) contains detailed information on the call for papers and a submission form. Proposals, along with an abstract of 250 words and six keywords, should be submitted by **31 March 2019**.
