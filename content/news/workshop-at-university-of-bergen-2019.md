Stefan Müller led a two-day workshop on quantitative text analysis using R and **quanteda** at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en) on 25–26 April 2019. The workshop was open to scholars from all across the [Faculty of Humanities](https://www.uib.no/en/hf). Researchers with backgrounds in political science, sociology, psychology, computer science, and linguistics participated in the event. Stefan covered topics such as constructing a corpus, importing textual data, tokenization, creating a document-feature matrix, applying and interpreting textual statistics, building supervised classifiers, as well as running and validating topic models.
