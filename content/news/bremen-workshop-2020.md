The workshop covered topics such as an quantitative text analysis and its workflow, an overview of **quanteda** and how to use it to create core objects, identifying key words based on statistical association measures, identifying multi-word expressions via collocation analysis, computing similarities and distances for clustering, feature weighting and feature selection for textual matrices, dictionary analysis, scaling and classification, and document scaling for measuring ideological positions.
