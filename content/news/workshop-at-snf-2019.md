Stefan MÃ¼ller led a two-day workshop on quantitative text analysis using R and **quanteda** at the [Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](http://www.snf.ch/en) in Berne on 30-31 July 2019. Participants from the SNSF learned how to construct a corpus, import textual data, tokenize text, create a document-feature matrix, and train and evaluate supervised classifiers. These steps were not only applied to corpora from the *quanteda* package, but also to newspaper articles covering the Swiss National Science Foundation.
