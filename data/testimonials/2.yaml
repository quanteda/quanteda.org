  The **quanteda** package has become the starting point for all my text analysis projects in R. 
  This is due to its superb ability to prepare the data for analysis regardless of the method one might prefer. 
  When the data is prepared, **quanteda**'s convert function makes it easy to transfer the data to a wide range of other packages such as topicmodels or lsa.
