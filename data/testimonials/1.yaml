  **quanteda** has become my first stop for content analysis, for both dictionary- and supervised-learning-focused projects. 
  Because it draws together so many different techniques, it facilitates a more comprehensive analysis of text as well â€“ it's 
  now very straightforward to compare results from several different approaches. 
  Both my research and teaching on content analysis are increasingly based on **quanteda**.
